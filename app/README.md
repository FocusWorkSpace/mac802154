# Applications
These applications demonstrate various features of the WSN library.

An application is any complete example that can be executed by a supported
target.

## Note
These applications are currently all broken due to the lack of an OS provided
by the WSN library! While they demonstrate the API, and will compile, they wont
actually run on hardware.
